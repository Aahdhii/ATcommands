This assignment focuses on understanding how AT commands handle errors and how to simulate and interpret error responses using a modem or emulator.

The goal is to:

Trigger errors intentionally using unsupported or malformed AT commands.

Enable verbose error reporting using the AT+CMEE=2 command (if supported).

Learn how to interpret ERROR and +CME ERROR responses.

In the CelerSMS AT Emulator, the command AT+CMEE=2 returns:

ERROR 

indicating that verbose error reporting is not supported in the emulator. Despite this limitation, error testing can still be performed by sending invalid commands such as:

AT+XYZ → Unknown command

AT+CMGS= → Missing parameter

AT+CMGR=100 → Invalid SMS index

Each of these results in a general ERROR, which must be interpreted manually based on the command context.

This assignment teaches how to identify errors, understand their causes, and prepares users for debugging real GSM/LTE modules.
